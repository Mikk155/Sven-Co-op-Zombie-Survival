# Sven-Co-op-Zombie-Survival

"What is zombie survival? the name sounds generic"

Yup. i don't know how to name them and i don't really care. This maps ( without definition of what "zombie survival" meant ) adds some new features such as the random weapons pack register. that mean every time the map starts it will use a different pack of weapons. (they're registered randomly do not worry about overflow precache)

"New" mystery box. literally an attempt to do that Call of duty zombie game's crate. 

A mystery icon can be spawned via the mystery crate and also npcs have a small chance to drop them. they look like a checkpoint but instead of a lambda it has a logo made by KEZAEIV that represents the letters MK

The zombies are models from Cry Of Fear. NOTE: just before you come to me saying something let me let you know. "i don't care. also no ones care" unless you come to me for making original models that can run that will be my response.

The custom npcs are just one npc custom named monster_custom_zombie originally made by DrAbcrealone & Goodman3 modified by Gaftherman and then modified by me.

The maps works doing use of squadmakers and script that will change their keyvalue "monstercount" every time all squadmakers reach their value to 0. starting a new round and resurrecting all dead players. that mean the rounds could be infinites if you want. but even so. some maps have ending optional that you'll need to reach certain points to finish it.

Script made by [Mikk](https://github.com/Mikk155) and [Gaftherman](https://github.com/Gaftherman) within 3 boring days.

**Suggestions:** 
- do a pull request then i'll add them
- a custom lobby like dynamic mapvote for all mkzs maps.
- an alternative mirror for weapon packs for balancing purposes
- animations for zombies for make them able to climb structures that players will use to prevent damage.
